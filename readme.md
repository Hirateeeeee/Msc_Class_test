Grader Script

This is a script I did a long time ago, 
it should justify the hardness of a assignment based on whether the mean grade is more than 1 sigma above or below
the average grade for the whole year.

The "grade.csv" is the original mark file date back to a long time ago
The "grade.py"  is the file where all the mark is plotted

This was actually a good idea in the past, but I can't remember why I have abondoned it

Give It a Try
